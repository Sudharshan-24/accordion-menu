                <div class="label">What is HTML?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language
                    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
                    by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
                    such as JavaScript.
                    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
                    and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure
                    of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
                    document.

                <div class="label">What is CSS?</div>
                <div class="content">
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
                    presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is
                    a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including 
                    layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, 
                    provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
                    characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the 
                    relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
                    structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page 
                    load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                <div class="content">
                    JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the 
                    ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and 
                    multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based 
                    object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. 
                    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party 
                    libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's 
                    device.

                <div class="content">
                    AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework for developing single-page
                    applications. It is maintained mainly by Google and a community of individuals and corporations. 
                    It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a 
                    framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, 
                    along with components commonly used in web applications and progressive web applications.
                    AngularJS is used as the frontend of the MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web 
                    application server framework, AngularJS itself (or Angular), and Node.js server runtime environment.

                <div class="content">
                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for 
                    building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual 
                    developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile 
                    applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, 
                    so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as 
                    certain client-side functionality.

                    Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript framework 
                    for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by 
                    him and the rest of the active core team members.

                <div class="content">
                    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine 
                    and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line 
                    tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page 
                    is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying 
                    web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side 
                    and client-side scripts.

                <div class="content">
                    Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers 
                    collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and 
                    support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
                    Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers 
                    contributing to its initial development.

                    Visual Studio Code is a code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for 
                    debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users 
                    can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.
                    Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License, while 
                    the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.
